Neural Bionics Lab @ Chalmers University of Technology
Empowering lives through neurotechnology

The Neural Bionics Lab, led by Dr. Giacomo Valle, is part of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Life Bionics at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden. Our mission is to develop advanced neurotechnologies that bridge the gap between the human nervous system and assistive devices, aiming to restore and enhance sensorimotor functions in individuals with neurological impairments.​

🔬 RESEARCH FOCUS
-  Intracortical Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs): Developing systems to restore somatosensation in individuals with paralysis.​
-  Bidirectional Neural Prosthetics: Creating prosthetic limbs that can both receive commands from and send sensory feedback to the nervous system.​
iHeart
-  In-Silico Modeling: Utilizing computational models to understand neural mechanisms and improve human-machine interfacing.​

🌐 GLOBAL COLLABORATIONS
We actively engage in international collaborations with academic institutions, hospitals, and industry partners worldwide. These partnerships facilitate data sharing, joint research projects, and the co-development of neurotechnologies, enhancing our mission to restore and augment human sensorimotor functions.
